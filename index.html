            <h3>Young Professional of Climate Chnage</h3>
            <p>Climate chnage is a real phenomenon. But my friend Donald Trump didn't address climate change is a result of anthropogenic intervention. Though I ain't aggred with my friend but i have lots of evidance of climate chnage. The chnages of the friquency and intensity of Flood and cyclone are one of them. <br>

                    NASA is responsible for collecting a large amount of data that show how our climate is changing due to both natural and human activities, from documenting its impacts on ice sheets, sea level, and Arctic sea ice, to monitoring the health of vegetation and the movement of fresh water. We are putting decades of research, technology, and innovation to work to improve the lives of the people right here, on our home planet.</p>

                        NASA is a world leader in climate studies and Earth science. While its role is not to set climate policy or prescribe particular responses or solutions to climate change, its purview does include providing the robust scientific data needed to understand climate change. NASA then makes this information available to the global community – the public, policy- and decision-makers and scientific and planning agencies around the world.</p>

            <h1> Sustaiable Development Goal </h1>
            <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in 2015 by the international community as part of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development through which countries of the world collectively pledged to eradicate poverty, find sustainable and inclusive development solutions, ensure everyone’s human rights, and generally make sure that no one is left behind by 2030. <br>

            The EU made a positive and constructive contribution to the development of the 2030 Agenda. We are committed to implement the SDGs in all our policies and encourage EU countries in doing the same. <br>
                
            17 SDGs have been defined, with 169 associated targets, to be reached by 2030. They address the global challenges the world faces and tackle all dimensions of sustainable development, in a balanced and integrated manner.</p>

            <h1> Build Back Better  </h1>
            <p>President Joe Biden believes that there’s no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people. But for too long, the economy has worked great for those at the top, while working families get squeezed. President Biden promised to rebuild the backbone of the country – the middle class – so that this time everyone comes along. The Build Back Better Framework does just that.</p>
